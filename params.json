  "body": "## Itroduction\r\nDevOps transformation goals can be defined as:\r\n * Heightened Release Agility\r\n * Improved Software Quality\r\n\r\nOr simply:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Delivering Better Software Faster\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTherefore the success criteria would be:\r\n * Being able to release versions faster and more often\r\n * Having less defects and failures\r\n \r\n\r\nIn order to measure DevOps success we need to have metrics for 2 categories:\r\n * __Velocity__ (time it takes to complete each step in the release/delivery cycle, number of releases per time period.)\r\n * __Quality__ (rate of defects per change, etc)\r\n\r\n## Velocity KPIs\r\n\r\n* __MLT__ (Mean Lead Time)\t \r\nhow long does it take for a bit of code to get built, tested and deployed.\r\n* __DCR__ (Daily Change Rate) \t\r\nnumber of changes getting committed to mainline and tested per day.\t\r\n* __MTTE__ (Mean Time To Environment) \t\r\nhow much time it takes developers/testers to bring up a testing environment for verifying each delivered change.\t\"\r\n* __MTTD__ (Mean Time to Detect) \t \r\nhow much time passes since the original commit of code until the bug it introduces gets detected.\r\n* __MTTR__ (Mean Time To Resolve) \t\r\nhow much time it takes to resolve an issue after itâ€™s detected\r\n* __MTTA__ (MeanTime To Approve)\t \r\nhow much time it takes to approve and verify a release. (Measured from the moment all release content has been delivered and until the release has passed all the defined test and verification cycles)\r\n\r\n## Quality KPIs\r\n\r\n* __BFR__ (Build Failure Rate)\r\n \t% of failed builds\t\t\r\n* __DFR__ (Deployment Failure Rate)\r\n \t% of failed deployments\t\t\r\n* __IRFR__ (Infrastructure-Related Failure Rate)\r\n% of build/deployment failures related to infrastructure issues\r\n* __RWR__ (Rework Rate)\r\n% of tickets being reopened\r\n* __ADR__ (Automated Detection Rate) \t\r\n% of defects being detected by automated testing cycles.\tQA\t\r\n* __UWR__ (Unplanned Work Rate)\r\n% of unplanned issues",
